Open ModPlug Tracker
====================


Installation
------------

* If you have an existing *portable* installation of OpenMPT and wish to re-use
  its settings, copy mptrack.ini, SongSettings.ini, Keybindings.mkb and
  plugin.cache to the directory into which you extract the archive.
* If there is no previous installation, you're done: just extract the archive
  and launch OpenMPT.exe.
* Hints on making an OpenMPT installation portable can be found in the
  System Setup chapter of the manual (OpenMPT Manual.chm).


Uninstallation
--------------

Delete the files extracted from the archive and optionally the OpenMPT setting
files, which are stored in %APPDATA%\OpenMPT if OpenMPT is not configured to be
portable.
